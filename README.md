# Customer Churn Analysis (Python & Power BI)

## Business Problem
Customer churn reduces revenue and increases acquisition costs. This project analyses customer behaviour to identify churn drivers and provide actionable retention recommendations.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify churn patterns
- Built a Power BI dashboard to track churn KPIs and customer segments
- Summarised insights and business recommendations

## Tools Used
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Power BI:** Data modelling, DAX measures, interactive dashboard  


## Dataset
Customer-level dataset containing demographics, account features, and churn label.

## Key Analyses
- Churn rate distribution
- Churn by age group / demographics
- Relationship between balance/tenure and churn
- Segment-level churn insights

## Key Insights
- Certain customer segments show higher churn risk (e.g., by age group, tenure, or product usage)
- Churn correlates with key account features (e.g., balance, activity, credit score—depending on your dataset)

## Business Recommendations
- Run targeted retention campaigns for high-risk segments
- Introduce incentives for customers showing early churn signals
- Monitor churn KPIs monthly and track improvements after interventions
